# Snake Game
This is a crude copy of the nokia's phone 'snake' game. 
It's just ment to give me some background with the p5.js library.

To run locally, install http-server from npm and then write 
>$ http-server
 
on the command line located in the folder of the project, this will serve the game on `localhost:8000`
